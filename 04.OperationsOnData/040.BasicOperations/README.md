# Basic Operations

### Integer Arithmetic
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division & Modulus Operations on Integer Data in C++
- [C++ Operator Precedence](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_precedence)
- Order for basic arithmetic operations run left to right and follow the following precedence
    - 1. Brackets (anything in brackets gets evaluated first) 
    - 2. ORders (log, expoent) 
    - 3. Division, Multiplication (equal precedence, order computed from left to right)
    - 4. Addition, Subtraction (equal precedence, order computed from left to right)

### Prefix & Postfix Incrememnt & Decrement
- Special operations to increment or decrement an integer value by 1
- When prefixed to the value, the computation is done instantly
- When postfixed the value is done after the execution of the statement calling the increment/decrement
