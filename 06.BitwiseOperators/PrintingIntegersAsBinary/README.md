# Printing Binary Numbers in C++

- Binary output not built into std::cout like hexadecimal/octal output is
- Need another library called <bitset>
- We can input binary literals using the prefix "0b", however printing this literal to the console will result in its decimal counterpart and not the binary literal
- Bitset can do much more than allow printing binary numbers to the console. However such things are beyond the immediate scope of this course.
