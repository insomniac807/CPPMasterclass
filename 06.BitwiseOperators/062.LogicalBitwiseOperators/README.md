# Logical Bitwise Operators

- Exact same logic gates used for code flow control but on a bit level
- & returns true if both bits are 1
- | returns true if either bit or both bits are 1. only returns false when both bits are 0
- ~ toggles 0 or 1. if bit is 1 ~bit returns 0 and vice versa
- ^ exclusive or. only returns true if one bit is 0 and other bit is 1.
