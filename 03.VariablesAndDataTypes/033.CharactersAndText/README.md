# Charaters and Text

### Characters

- datatype keyword = char
- wrap in single quotes to assign data
- stores a single ASCII character
- Example declaration : char character {'a'};
- One char = 1 byte in memory
- [ASCII Table](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.html)
- Characters can be initalised with the integer associated with their ASCII counterpart
- E.G : char character = 65; loads the value 'A' into RAM
- character data can be recalled either as the character literal or their ASCII integral counterpart
