# Decimals & Integers

### Integers
- 4 Bytes in RAM (32 bits)
- Signed by default (i.e. can contain positive or negative numbers)
- Can be modified to use more or less bytes in RAM OR to increase the range of possible positive values
- unsigned keyword modifier disables negative value possibilities and allocates full 32 bit range for positive whole numbers
- short keyword modifier allocates 2 bytes of RAM for int instead of 4. Can be used with signed or unsigned ints
- long keyword modifier allocates 4 OR 8 bytes of RAM for signed or unsigned ints depending on value
- long long keyword modifier allocates 8 bytes (64 bits) or RAM for signed or unsigned ints
