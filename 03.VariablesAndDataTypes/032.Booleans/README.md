# Booleans

- 1 of 2 states
- Either true or false
- Takes up 1 byte (8 bits) of memory
- Wasteful as can be represented with a single bit but ig not to worry?
- datatype keyword is "bool" and values are lowercase "true" or "false"
- bool values get printed to console as either 1 or 0
- 1 means true and 0 means false
