# Statements and Functions in C++

### What Defines a Statement?

- Basic unit of computation in a C++ Program
- Every C++ program is a collection of statements organized in a certain way to achieve some goal.  
- Statements in C++ end with a semicolon (;)
- Statements are executed in order from top to bottom when the program is run
- Execution keeps going until there is a statement causing the program to terminate, or run another sequence of statements  

### What Defines a Function?

- Reusable collection of statements surrounding a common task
- Generally takes one or many inputs but can sometimes take no inputs
- Usually used to produce outputs based on these inputs. Or if no inputs given, some other form of output.
- If output or not, function used to perform some operation on some data
- Functions should be reusable blocks of code
- Functions need to be declared before they are called
- In C++ Functions must be defined with a return type
- The Syntax for Declaring a function is as follows:
- DataType function_name(dataType param1, dataType param2) {...function statements...}
